title: My First Blog Post!

Hello.  A little bit about me....  I've been a reaserch scientist for many years getting my start in high school as a summer intern at NASA AMES Research Center in Mountain View, CA.  Since then I've worked at many of Silicon Valley's leading research institutues.  Now I'm studing data science.

Why?  Because I find it interesting and the subject matter appeals to my problem solving instincts.  After some gently probbling from friends, I started my foray into data science ~2 years ago at Coursera.   Since then I got the data science bug.  Now I'm at Metis honing my data science skills. 

Skill number one is Python programing.  I stated Python self study about a year ago then went on to formal study at the Data Incubator (Thank You [Jim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-schmitz-390645/)!).

So I had a decent backgound starting python here at Metis.  However, I'm still getting use to python's "clunkyness" .  That hasn't stopped me from getting some useful info from the [MTA database](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).  If I were registering student voters I'd like setup my boot at a MTA station near a CUNY school in Queens as apposed at a station stop near Columbia.
